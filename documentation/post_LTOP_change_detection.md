#### Methods for change detection from optimized LandTrendr (LT) outputs
The following descriptions are for three methods for calculating or identifying pixels that experienced some kind of change over the course of the image time series. It is important to note that the methods described here are aimed at change detection not change attribution. That is to say that they highlight pixels that experienced some kind of change based on different rules or trend-based criteria (described below) but they do not identify pixels that moved from forest to pasture. Additional methods employing land use/land cover classifications and similar approaches are suggested for doing these kinds of change attribution studies. 

The following methods are included in this description: 

1. Standard identification of singular events based on existing LT modules and LTOP outputs 
2. Vertex-based information for temporal understanding of change 
3. Annual canopy cover mapping and delta tracking
